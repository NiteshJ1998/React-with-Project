# 1️⃣ useEffect Hook (React Lifecycle)

Concept:

useEffect lets you perform side effects in your components.
(Side effects = anything that happens outside the component’s rendering, like fetching data, setting timers, or updating the DOM.)

It’s React’s way to handle lifecycle events:

When the component mounts (loads)

When it updates

When it unmounts
